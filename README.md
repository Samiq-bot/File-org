File Organizer
This simple Python script helps you organize your files by categorizing them into folders based on their file extensions. The script categorizes files into the following folders:

python files: Default folder for Python scripts.
document: Folder for document files (e.g., doc, docx, pdf, txt).
video: Folder for video files (e.g., mp4, avi, mkv).
picture: Folder for image files (e.g., jpg, png, gif).
executable: Folder for executable files (e.g., exe, bat).
others: Folder for files that don't match any predefined categories.
Usage
Run the script in the directory you want to organize.
The script will create the necessary folders if they don't already exist.
Files will be moved to their respective folders based on their file extensions.
Supported File Types
Document: doc, docx, txt, pdf, rtf, odt, csv, xlsx, xls, pptx, ppt, odp, html
Video: mp4, avi, mkv, mov, wmv, flv, webm, m4v, mpeg, mpg, 3gp, 3g2
Music: mp3, wav, ogg, flac, aac, wma, m4a, alac, aiff, mid, midi
Picture: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, webp, svg, ico, jfif, heif, raw
Executable: exe, dmg, app, apk, msi, bat, sh
Note
The script ignores itself (file_org.py) to prevent moving the script file.
Feel free to modify the code and add more file extensions or customize folder names based on your preferences. Happy organizing!
